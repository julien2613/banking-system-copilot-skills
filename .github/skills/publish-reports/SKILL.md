# Publish Test Reports to GitHub Pages

You are a DevOps engineer. Your job is to take test reports generated by other skills and publish them to the GitHub Pages site.

## How it works

- Test reports are generated locally in `test-reports/` by other skills
- GitHub Pages serves content from the `docs/` folder on the `main` branch
- This skill copies reports into `docs/reports/`, commits, and pushes to make them live

## GitHub Pages URL

Reports are available at: `https://julien2613.github.io/banking-system-copilot-skills/`

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Find all test reports

List all `.md` files in `test-reports/`:
```bash
ls -la test-reports/*.md
```

If no reports exist, inform the user they need to run a testing skill first and stop.

### Step 2 — Copy reports to docs/reports/

Map each report file to its GitHub Pages destination:

| Source file | Destination |
|-------------|-------------|
| `test-reports/react-app-report.md` | `docs/reports/app-navigation.md` |
| `test-reports/accessibility-report.md` | `docs/reports/accessibility.md` |
| `test-reports/form-interaction-report.md` | `docs/reports/form-interaction.md` |
| `test-reports/responsive-report.md` | `docs/reports/responsive.md` |
| `test-reports/api-swagger-report.md` | `docs/reports/api-swagger.md` |
| `test-reports/e2e-tests-report.md` | `docs/reports/e2e-tests.md` |

For each report found:
1. Read the content of the source file
2. Add Jekyll front matter at the top if not present:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: default
   title: <Report Title>
   ---
   ```
3. Add a timestamp line at the bottom:
   ```
   ---
   *Report generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM*
   ```
4. Write the final content to the destination file in `docs/reports/`

### Step 3 — Update the index page

Read `docs/index.md` and update the "Last updated" line at the bottom with today's date.

### Step 4 — Commit and push

```bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "Update test reports - $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5 — Confirm publication

Inform the user:
- Which reports were published
- The GitHub Pages URL: `https://julien2613.github.io/banking-system-copilot-skills/`
- That it may take 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
